AD-Prototype
============

Drawing app prototype for iOS developed during my third year work placement in college.
I followed this tutorial [http://www.raywenderlich.com/18840/how-to-make-a-simple-drawing-app-with-uikit] and added some extras. 
It includes brush, erase, undo, redo, color picker, text input, saving and opening images, and sharing images to Facebook or Twitter.
